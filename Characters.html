        <li> Winston Smith</li>
        <p>Winston Smith is the main Protagionist of 1984. His first name derives from Wynnstan which means joy stone.
            His surname Smith means that he is a blacksmith hence a person who creates happiness. He starts from someone
            who likes the government to hating it and trying to escape it. We don't know his particular fate. He could
            die or he could live. But it's assumed that he beat O'Brien at his own game since he dies with being able to
            have freedom. Despite his execution he was able to die with freedom rather than dying being a slave. This is
            what I assume happens. He is drinking and able to confess everything that he did which means that O'Brien
            Lost. He Failed to actually convert him before he dies. Instead he became something beyond him. Someone who
            is ableo to look past their own desires and accept fate.
        </p>
        <li>Julia</li>
        <p> Her name is from early Saints and Martyrs which is probably the meaning since Julia was the person who
            exposed Oceania censorship and Mass-Surveillence to Winston. She does ultimately betray him and she sells
            him out for herself. She was only acting like this for herself and never cared about winston. </p>
        <li>O'Brien.</li>
        <p> He is the main antagionist of the story. Not even being mentioned untill the last 8 chapters. He is
            unassuming and his name means hill or strength. He is quite far above Julia and Winston in terms of
            authority. He works with Winston in the department of fiction. Which at this point he is idolized by all of
            his workers. He then reveals after Winston is arrested and imprisioned that he will make him convert to
            their beliefes. He does this by tourturing him. But the novel is unresolved so we don't know if he is going
            to die.</p>
