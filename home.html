        <p>
            1984 is a fairly complicated novel about how Winston Smith and Julia try to rebel against their own slavery.
            It
            focuses on broad topics like Mass-surveillence and censorship and deals with topics such as governments
            controlling
            thought, behavior, and most importantly free-will. It was written by George Orwell in 1949 and is set in a dystopian future.</p>
